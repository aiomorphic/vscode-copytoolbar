### New Feature: `.gitignore` Compliance

**Respect `.gitignore`:** The extension now respects the `.gitignore` file, automatically filtering out any files and folders specified within it. If you find that the copy operation includes files you donâ€™t want to be included, simply add those files or directories to your `.gitignore`, and they will be excluded from future copies.
